# Manter

This project aims to create a terminal with functionalities that improve the experience of using terminals. Examples of useful functionalities would be autocomplete suggestion, showing the current branch of a project, prepared scripts that can be reused, and others. You can come up with your ideas. The project uses technologies such as Svelte on the front-end, which offers flexibility regarding the implementation of the interface. On the back-end side, the most importatn part is the PTY. All the back end is implemented in Rust. The basic framework of the project is Tauri.

A good analogy to understand the purpose of this project is the following - traditional terminals are like simple code editors while this terminal is like an IDE.

### The following animation represents an example of what can be achieved with this project. But this is just a tiny part of what can be done. This demo was done with the actual project but the autocompletion part was removed for a better implementation.

## Setup local development environment

_First off, thank you for considering contributing to Manter. Itâ€™s people like you that can make Manter a great tool._

1. install the latest LTS NodeJS

2. install the latest LTS Rust

3. clone the repository

4. install the dependencies `npm install`

5. run the application in dev environment `npm run tauri dev`

You can keep the application running in the dev environment and the changes in code will be reflected in the application running application. If the back-end code changes, then the application restarts to reflect the changes.

Build the installer with `npm run tauri build`.

The installer that has been built will be for the operating system that you are using. The terminal can be built for Linux, MacOS and Windows.
